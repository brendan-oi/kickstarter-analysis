Here we analyze a broad traunch of Kickstarter data, paying special attention to data on theatrical and musical productions in order to glean useful information about what makes campaigns succeed or fail.  

The chart below shows a notable uptick in campaign the success rate for campaigns launched in May - June. It also shows that kickstarter in September and particularly December have a low success rate.

Of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe kickstarters that that we examined, all had a goal of less the £4,000. Infact the mean and median were £2,100 and £2,000 respectively, demonstrating that campaigns can be successful and resulting in inspiring productions with relativle modest goals.

Zooming out to theater productions more broadly, failed campaigns in this category set substantially higher fundraising goals than successful campaigns. Higher goals might not be the only reason these campaigns fails: the mean and median pledged amounts are much lower for failed campaigns than for successful ones.

Note that the mean campaign goal is close to £4,000, but this is more than the even the highest amount pledged, £4,000. Half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.
