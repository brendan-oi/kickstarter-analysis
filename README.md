Here we analyze a broad traunch of Kickstarter data, paying special attention to data pertaining to theatrical and musical productions in order to glean useful information about what makes campaigns succeed or fail.  

The chart below suggests that the months of May and June are both advantageous times to launch a kick starter.

Of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe kickstarters that that we examined, all had a goal of less the £4,000. Infact the mean and median were £2,100 and £2,000 respectively.

Compairing the data reveals that failed Kickstarter campaigns set substantially higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns. The data also suggests that higher goals are not the only reason a campaign fails: the mean and median pledged amounts are much lower for failed campaigns than for successful ones. 

BOX AND WISKER PLOT HERE

The mean campaign goal is close to £4,000, but this is  than the range of outliers for amount pledged, so fro a campaign to succeed it should probably try to get her play produced for less than £4,000. Half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.
